Additional tips:

* To **get out of highlighted address bar** in Google Chrome, add "javascript:" (without the quotes) as an addition search engine in settings. Then, when the address bar is highlighted, just type "javascript:" and you are taken back to the page.

* Showing battery status in tmux: https://github.com/Goles/Battery

TODO! 

Automatically uninstall existing tmux if exists and install tmux 2.1 from source instead!
